Sterling, like Alloy, is a self-contained executable which includes the Kodkod
model finder, a variety of SAT solvers, the standard Alloy library, and a
collection of tutorial examples. Additionally, the web interface is included
so that a network connection is not needed to use Sterling. To execute, simply
double-click on the jar file, or type `java -jar Sterling-0.3.0.jar`,
replacing the version to match the one you have downloaded.
