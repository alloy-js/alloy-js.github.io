title: "Introducing Sterling"
---

In this post, we introduce the basic features currently provided by Sterling, as
well as a general overview of how Sterling works.  In its current state,
Sterling mostly attempts to replicate the functionality of the Alloy visualizer.
This is meant to be the first stepping-stone along the path to more robust and
customizable visualizations.
