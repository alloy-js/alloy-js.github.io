This page gives a quick introduction to Sterling's features. As it is
under active development, expect this page to change as new features are added
and existing ones are tweaked.

*This tour is for [version 0.3.0](/download/).*

## Alloy

Sterling is built on top of [Alloy 5.0.0.1](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy/releases/tag/v5.0.0.1), making only a few minor changes to
the Alloy interface to support a connection to the browser.

Note the message `Visualization server running: http://localhost:45441`. You can
click this link to open the Sterling visualizer in the browser, or you can wait
to open it from the built-in Alloy visualizer. Also note that the port is chosen
automatically and changes each time Sterling is opened.

To the left of the `Theme` button there is now a `Web` button that will open
the Sterling visualizer in the browser.
