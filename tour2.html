<p>
    Welcome to Sterling! On this page, we give a brief introduction to the
    Sterling user interface through Alloy Sterling. After taking this tour, you'll
    know how to navigate the views provided by Sterling and you'll be ready
    to explore some of the more in-depth features and settings on your own.
</p>

<h2>Alloy Sterling</h2>
<p>
    Sterling is a web-based visualizer capable of displaying instances generated
    by model finding tools such as Alloy. While it is capable of displaying data
    from tools other than Alloy, we use Alloy Sterling &mdash; a version of Alloy
    that ships with the Sterling visualizer &mdash; to introduce the interface. This
    tour is for Alloy Sterling 1.0, which can be downloaded <a href='/download/'>here</a>.
</p>

        <p>
            Alloy Sterling is built on top of Alloy 5.0.0.1, making only two
            small additions to the Alloy interface to support connection to the
            browser. When Alloy Sterling is first launched, you are given a link
            that will open Sterling in your default browser. Additionally, a
            "Web" button that does the same has been added to the Alloy
            visualizer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alloy is unchanged aside from these two additions, and
            using Sterling to visualize instances is entirely opt-in.

<h2>Sterling</h2>

<p>
    To Alloy users, Sterling will likely feel very familiar. The interface draws
    inspiration from Alloy, and many of its features have been migrated to Sterling.
    Much like the built-in Alloy visualizer, Sterling displays only a single
    instance at a time.
</p>

<div class='row'>
    <div>

        <p>
            Sterling provides three views &mdash; Graph, Table, and Source &mdash;
            that are accessible from the navigation bar at the top of the window.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Graph</strong> - A directed graph view of the instance</li>
            <li><strong>Table</strong> - A set of tables showing all sets and relations in the instance</li>
            <li><strong>Source</strong> - All source code files used to generate the instance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <strong>Next</strong> button at the right side of the navigation bar
            can be used to generate and display the next solution.
        </p>

                The sidebar, on the left edge of the screen, has buttons that
                will open a drawer which contains tools or options. The buttons above the
                divider are specific to the currently active view &mdash; Graph in
                the image to the right &mdash; and those below the divider are
                tools that are available regardless of the currently active view.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a look at what each view has to offer, starting with the
                Graph view.

<h3>The Graph View</h3>
<p>
    The graph view displays the current instance as a directed graph, and provides
    a lot of the same functionality as the Viz tab in Alloy. For example, projections
    are fully supported and relations can be viewed as attributes. Additionally,
    graph nodes are draggable and the view can be panned and zoomed. The following
    video gives a brief tour of some of the basic functionality in the Graph view
    (hover over the video to show controls &mdash; full screen is available).

            <source src='/assets/tour/graph/graph-1.webm' type='video/webm'>

    </div>

            <p>
                Compared to the Alloy visualizer, there are a few key differences in
                the graph view, all of which are demonstrated in the video above.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Node placement is not limited to rows and so you
                    are free to drag them anywhere in the graph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The layout is not updated by default when a projection or
                    instance is changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A handful of additional layout methods are provided, and you may
                    apply them at any time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class='vr'></div>
        <div class='text'>
            <p>
                The sidebar buttons for the Graph view are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul style='list-style-type: none'>
                <li>
                    <img src='/assets/tour/sidebar/sidebar-0.png' alt=''> &mdash; Projections and Node Styling
                </li>

                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>The Table View</h3>
<p>
    The Table view displays the signatures, fields, and skolems of the current
    instance as a set of tables. Advanced sorting and filtering options make it
    easy to explore the instance and find the specific data you're looking for.
    Furthermore, Sterling introduces the ability to highlight skolemized
    variables, as shown in the video below.
</p>
<div class='row'>
    <div class='full-row'>
        <video class='full' autoplay loop controls muted playsinline>
            <source src='/assets/tour/table/table-0.webm' type='video/mp4'>
            <source src='/assets/tour/table/table-0.webm' type='video/webm'>
        </video>
    </div>
</div>

<!--<hr/>-->

<h3>The Source View</h3>
<p>
    The source view simply provides you with all of the Alloy source files used
    to generate the currently displayed instance. They are not editable files,
    and simply serve as a convenient way to refer back to the models.
</p>
<div class='row'>
    <div class='full-row'>
        <img class='full' src='/assets/tour/source/source-0.png' alt=''>
    </div>
</div>

<!--<hr/>-->

<h3>The Evaluator</h3>
<p>
    The evaluator is a drawer tool that is accessible from any view by clicking
    on the terminal icon in the sidebar. It provides the same evaluator functionality
    that you are used to in Alloy and allows you to toggle between textual and
    tabular views of the results.
